# Traffic Congestion Control in a Grid Network of Intersections with Poisson Arrivals

## Background

This simulation tool was developed as a part of my project in the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship 2022. The program simulates and collects data on the flow of vehicles in a grid network of four-way intersections. The vehicles arrive in each lane according to a Poisson process.
